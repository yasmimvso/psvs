        <p>

            PSVS 24 (Pernambuco Seminar on Visualization and Sustainability) will be a pioneering milestone in the
            community
            of human-nature interactions. This inaugural event is the first of its kind, dedicated to exploring and
            promoting sustainable physicalizations.

            The organization of PSVS 24 involves the collaboration of a diverse and experienced committee, comprising
            general chairs responsible for the overall supervision of the event, program chairs in charge of
            coordinating
            the program content, sustainability chairs focused on integrating sustainable practices, diversity, equity,
            and
            inclusion chairs promoting inclusiveness and equity, a design and social media chair managing design and
            digital
            communication, and a hybrid experience chair responsible for integrating in-person and virtual experiences.
            Additionally, sustainability assistants and student volunteers will support the event's operations.

            The aim of PSVS 24 is to promote the exchange of knowledge and experiences about sustainable practices in
            physicalizations, contributing to a more sustainable future. The presence of such a diverse and committed
            group
            ensures that PSVS 24 will be an inclusive and innovative event, setting new guidelines for future events in
            the
            field.
